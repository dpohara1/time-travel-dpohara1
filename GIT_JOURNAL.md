I learned how to push files from terminal to GitHub and create new branches. One mistake I fixed was when pushing the tags, I didn't specify origin. After doing this, the tag was successfully pushed. Another mistake I fixed was that I got an error saying that my branch was ahead of the origin by 1 commit. The command that saved the day is what fixed this issue, which was git pull --rebase origin $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD). This re-synced everything and allowed me to push once again.
